    "about": {
        "title": "What is Grow With You?",
        "description": "Grow With You is a service created to simplify a mother's life. We want to relieve you of the worries of constantly looking for new toys for your baby and the headache where to keep the unneeded ones.",
        "why1": "Why the subscription - you may wonder. The child constantly needs to update toys: it grows, and from mobiles and teethers quickly moves to sorters and puzzles. We help you find all the toys that are best for your baby's early development.",
        "why2": "Why the subscription for renting toys is the next question. Of course, not all toys become \"favorite\" for your child: and if the sheep becomes a constant companion for the baby, the pyramid and the interactive cube will fall into disfavor in a month or two.",
        "howItStarted": {
            "title": "How did it all start?",
            "first": "We've promoted responsible consumption and production as a public organization. After researching the problems in these areas, we've wanted to do something that would help people and make their lives more environmentally friendly.",
            "second": "Meanwhile, we've talked to mothers and learned that they do not always have time to look for toys and need to buy them constantly: the child grows, develops, and learns about the world through games. At the same time, the period of use of toys is rather short, and then mum needs to think where to store / to whom to give already unneeded toys.",
            "third": "Thus was born the idea of a subscription service for children's toys, which allows baby to try many different toys and find the ones he likes. For the mother is it the chance not to spend time and effort on selecting toys and deciding their future."
        },
        "goal": "Everything is simple. We want to change the traditional model of kid's toys consumption, which will increase the number of cycles of their use by 4 times."
